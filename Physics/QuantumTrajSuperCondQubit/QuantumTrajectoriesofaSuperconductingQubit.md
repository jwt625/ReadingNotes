## Quantum Trajectories of a Superconducting Qubit

Jan 31, 2017

The experiments discussed in this thesis use superconducting circuits to study the process
of measurement of a quantum system.

These are the first experiments to successfully track diffusive
quantum trajectories in a solid state system. Furthermore, these are the first experiments
on any system to use quantum state tomography at discrete times along the trajectory
to verify that we have faithfully tracked the qubit state.

### Parameters

- measurement quantum efficiency $\eta$

### Acronyms and concepts

- HEMT: high electron mobility transistors, usually at 4K, can only achieve $ \eta\sim 1$
- QND: quantum non-demolition measurement: cases no backaction on the measured observable beyond the usual backaction associated with the acquisition of information
- Heisenberg backaction: the act of acquiring information about one observable will necessarily perturb its canonically conjugate observable
- standard quantum limit

### Continuous quantum measurement

Example of non-QND measurement: measure $x$ of a HO: $\psi (x)\propto \mathrm{exp}[-m \omega x^2/2\hbar] $. $\Delta p$ increase after the measurement and the time evolution of $x$ is perturbed.

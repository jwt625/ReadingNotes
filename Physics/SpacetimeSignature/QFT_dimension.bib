  abstract={We propose a possible answer to one of the most exciting open questions in physics and cosmology, that is, the question why we seem to experience four-dimensional spacetime with three ordinary and one time dimensions. Making assumptions (such as particles being in first approximation massless) about the equations of motion, we argue for restrictions on the number of space and time dimensions. Accepting our explanation of the spacetime signature and the number of dimensions would be a point supporting (further) the importance of the 'internal space'.}

abstract = "We are answering the question why 4-dimensional space has the metric 1+3 by making a general argument from a certain type of equations of motion linear in momentum for any spin (except spin zero) in any even dimension d. All known free equations of motion for non-zero spin for massless fields belong to this type of equations. Requiring Hermiticity1With respect to requiring Hermiticity, this is a generalization of an earlier work which shows that without assuming the Lorentz invariance – which in the present work is assumed – the Weyl equation follows using Hermiticity. 1 of the equations of motion operator as well as irreducibility with respect to the Lorentz group representation, we prove that only metrics with the signature corresponding to q time + (d−q) space dimensions with q being odd exist. Correspondingly, in four dimensional space, Nature could only make the realization of 1+3-dimensional space. "

abstract = "It is suggested that not only the curvature, but also the signature of spacetime is subject to quantum fluctuations. A generalized D-dimensional spacetime metric of the form gμν = eμaηabeνb is introduced, where ηab=diag{eiθ, 1, …, 1}. The corresponding functional integral for quantized fields then interpolates from a euclidian path integral in euclidean space, at θ = 0, to a Feynman path integral in Minkowski space, at θ=π. Treating the phase eiθ as just another quantized field, the signature of spacetime is determined dynamically by its expectation value. The complex-valued effective potential V(θ) for the phase field, induced by massless field at one-loop, is considered. It is argued that Re[V (θ)] is stationary, uniquely in D=4 dimensions, at θ=π which suggests a dynamical origin for the lorentzian signature of spacetime. "

  abstract={The authors point out that the classical Einstein field equations, suitably interpreted, allow a change of signature of spacetime. Specific examples of such changes are constructed in the case of Robertson-Walker geometries. They obtain classical solutions that have properties similar to those obtained in quantum cosmologies obeying the Hartle-Hawking 'no boundary' condition: these singularity-free universes have no beginning, but they do have an origin of time. They can be regarded either as classical analogues of the quantum cosmology results, or as classical solutions where a quantum cosmology era is avoided.}

abstract = "We describe a method for deriving general gauge-invariant field theories from light-cone representations of the Poincaré algebra at x+ = 0. By adding 2 commuting and 2 anticommuting dimensions, we obtain an enlarged symmetry group which includes the usual covariantly realized Poincaré group acting on D coordinates. The generators of the Lorentz subgroup which acts on the remaining, unphysical coordinates are used to define the gauge transformations. These generators are the BRST and anti-BRST operators, the SU(1,1) which defines the physical subspace, and generators which gauge away the unphysical coordinates. The free action, which is free of Nakanishi-Lautrup auxiliary fields, is just a δ function in these generators. The unphysical commuting coordinate can describe the string length as a gauge degree of freedom."
